Tuba is a large, purple gorilla with a tuba on each shoulder, hence her name. 
She also wears a brown satchel for storing items, such as a musical rock. 
In "The Debutante Ball Car", she wears a sky blue sun hat with flowers in it and a matching shawl with a magenta floral pattern on the trim. 
Tuba is shown to be friendly to others and protective of her friends, but can be aggressive if need be. 
She is mostly quiet, which Hazel notes as her being shy. 
Tuba cares very much about Hazel, presumably because she reminds Tuba of her late daughter Bugle.
